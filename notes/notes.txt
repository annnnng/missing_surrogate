We're trying to do MAR with the following missing mechanism:
For the treatment group (Z=1):
- when Y < median(Y), then there is a 70% chance of being observed 
- otherwise, fully observed
* This seems to be when the outcome is low, we don't have as much measurement
For the control group (Z=0):
- when Y > median(Y), then there is a 60% chance of being observed 
- otherwise, fully observed
* This seems to be when the outcome is high, we don't have as much measurement
? when does this comes up in practice

For this scenario, the complete case would over-estimate the proportion of treatment explained (R.s).
For the following, we assume that the weights (w) is known:
- For treatment, when Y < median(Y), then w=0.7; otherwise, w = 1
- For control, when Y > median(Y), then w=0.6; otherwise, w = 1
? This is a lot of information. Do we typically know this weights distribution in practice?

Layla has fixed this problem with IPW in her non-parametric methods by doing the following:
- Find delta using the complete case difference in weighted outcomes mean (weighted y1 - weighted y0)
- Find delta.s using the non-parametric approach with known weights
- Find R = 1-delta.s/delta

We try IPW with the full Wang's approach as follow:
- Fit a weighted lm Y ~ Z + S + Z*S to find the gammas
- Fit a weighted / complete case lm S ~ Z to find the alphas
- Find delta = (gamma2 - gamma0)  + gamma3* alpha1 - + gamma1 *  alpha0
- Find delta.s = (gamma2 - gamma0) + (gamma3 - gamma1) * alpha0 
- Find R = 1-delta.s/delta
* This approach yield a biased estimator

We try IPW again, but modify it:
- Find delta = weighted y1 - weighted y0

Seems like it's the delta piece that is biasing the results
Interesting notes that lm complete case will yield different results from using the complete case mean

Figure it out! I was implementing the IPW piece wrong
Rerunning the code now! Wondering if:
+ We can utilise smle to also find expectation of S in the same or different step
+ How to best find the weights?
+ Does weighted different in Y the same as IPW
+ Maybe run stuff on the cluster lol
+ Can we make this anymore efficient
