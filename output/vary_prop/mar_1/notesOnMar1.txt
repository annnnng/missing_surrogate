the missingness mechanism is as follow:
+ S1 is observed for some percentage if Y is less than the median
+ S0 is observed for some percentage if Y is more than the median


m2.1 = rep(1,n1)
m2.1[y1 < median(y1)] = rbinom(sum(y1 < median(y1)),1,prop_obs_s1)
m2.0 = rep(1,n0)
m2.0[y0 > median(y0)] = rbinom(sum(y0 > median(y0)),1,prop_obs_s0)
df$Miss = c(m2.0, m2.1)
df$Smiss[c(m2.0, m2.1) == 0] = NA
